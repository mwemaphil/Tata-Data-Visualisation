# TATA DATA VISUALIZATION 
### Project from Forage done by Philip Mwema
###### Analysis was done using Tableau

The following is an analysis done from [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/MyXvBcppsW2FkNYCX?ref=oTHjxvZrjokS5pYQ5) provided materials on virtual internship with data provided from Tata. 
After assessing the data and performing some cleanup of the data I came up with questions that i'll need to answer in order to satisfy the need for the insights.
Some of the issues found include:
  1. Erroneous quantity, whereby some quantity was in negative values -  I removed the negative values i.e values below 1.
  2. Erroneous Unit prices likewise had negative values which is abnormal and consequetially i removed all the negative values.
  
**All this was done in Tableau, created new calculated fields to filter out the unwanted data.**
## Regional Sales Revenue over Time

### Insights to discover:
## 1. Country Sales Demand over Time
![Region Demographics](https://github.com/mwemaphil/Tata-Data-Visualisation/assets/45120853/4d5eea31-18e3-4e14-86dd-693589c59bbc)
The above map is the distribution of revenue analysis by country denoted by color.

## 2. Monthly and Revenue Data:
![Monthly Quantity   Revenue](https://github.com/mwemaphil/Tata-Data-Visualisation/assets/45120853/6ec0ce0b-8dca-4e71-8390-0ab0b697ae9d)
From the line time series analysis Sales Revenue and Quantity have a close correlation with both increasing gradually from January 2011 to an all high in November 2011, probably due to Black Friday offers normally in the month of November, before declining ubruptly in the month of December.

## 3. Top 10 countries with the most revenue
![Region (Revenue vs Demand)](https://github.com/mwemaphil/Tata-Data-Visualisation/assets/45120853/19ce6010-5445-45df-8440-3880dac0f032)
The country with the highest Revunue is EIRE (Irish for Ireland), followed by the Netherlands and closing at top 10 is Japan.
Additionally i've added a line graph to show the demand in these countries where we can see that as much as EIRE is leading in sales, the Netherlands lead in Quantity ordered (demand in this case) followed by EIRE and so on.

## 4. Leading Customers
![Top 10 Customers Vs Revunue](https://github.com/mwemaphil/Tata-Data-Visualisation/assets/45120853/098084d5-731d-4d4e-ad39-9e16c7f676c1)
Leading customers in terms of frequency did not generally  result in high revenues as illustrated by the above visualization.
