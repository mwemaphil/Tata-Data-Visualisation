# TATA DATA VISUALIZATION 
### Project from Forage done by Philip Mwema
###### Analysis was done using Tableau

The following is an analysis done from [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/MyXvBcppsW2FkNYCX?ref=oTHjxvZrjokS5pYQ5) provided materials on virtual internship with data provided from Tata. 
After assessing the data and performing some cleanup of the data I came up with questions that i'll need to answer in order to satisfy the need for the insights.
Some of the issues found include:
  1. Erroneous quantity, whereby some quantity was in negative values -  I removed the negative values i.e values below 1.
  2. Erroneous Unit prices likewise had negative values which is abnormal and consequetially i removed all the negative values.
  
**All this was done in Tableau, created new calculated fields to filter out the unwanted data.**

### Questions to answer:
## 1. Monthly and Revenue Data:
